# Critical-Mass-Application
Hello! Welcome to my Internship Interview Assignment for Critical Mass's Summer 2018 Developer Internship.

## Work / Project Examples
*This is a showcase of a few of my recent work examples*

### CoffeeSpots
[CoffeeSpots](https://koffe.surge.sh/ "CoffeeSpots") is my most recent and largest personal project to date; built using React.js, CoffeeSpots uses the Google Maps/Places APIs to find and display the hottest local coffee shops, anywhere in the world. As a personal project, I used CoffeeSpots to both learn React and push my development skills further than they've ever been pushed before. For instance, I learned the ins and outs of React's "state" feature to control the app's UI, as React's state is what allows CoffeeSpots to interactively display information. That said, I also had to apply my problem solving skills to solve the challenges that come with React's powerful state feature - in particular, whenever a component's state is updated, it re-renders. So, since I was using state to determine whether the Google Maps/Places API data (used to display the map and find the coffee shops) has been received, the map kept re-rendering as data came in. As such, I had to filter through the state changes and manually determine which ones would trigger a map re-render. Overall, despite the challenges, I managed to produce an application that I'm proud of - it performs its intended functionality, and was a strong learning experience for me.

### Processing Parking Lot Simulator
My [introductory programming course's final project](https://github.com/oscarwong67/ENGG-233-Parking-Lot-Simulator) was a "parking lot simulator", using the Processing Language (Java-based language with an expansive library of 2D/3D shapes/drawing tools). This parking lot simulator was a group project with a partner, with both partners acting as developers. I was the main architect behind the project, designing the general systems behind the application's core features. In particular, I designed and implemented the system to track the number of cars in the parking lot, the system to have cars randomly enter and exit the lot at different times, and the system to keep track of/calculate fares. This project taught me a lot about the issues behind dealing with asynchronus code, because one of Processing's core features is its "draw()" function, which runs sixty times per second - this is what allow for the Processing apps' animations to run, but causes issues when managing dozens of objects doing different things, all at once; this project also served as a great experience in terms of learning teamwork, project management, and pair programming - it's significantly different than the personal projects I'd been used to, but I worked extremely well with my partner, and exhibited strong communication skills throughout the project.

### Danica Discord Bot
[Danica](https://github.com/oscarwong67/danica-bot) is a chat bot that I built for the [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) voice/text chat platform. Danica was my first real open source contribution, and I also built it in order to gain experience with basic AI (and because I wanted to use the bot's main features on my own server). The bot's main features are the ability to split the users in a server into two randomized, even teams, to query the Urban Dictionary API (useful when your friends are shouting new slang at you!), and to play a handful of predefined sounds in a voice server. This bot uses a Node.js library called Discord.js, and taught me a fair bit about processing user input. For instance, when a user enters one of Danica's commands, I had to deal with managing case-sensitivity, common spelling mistakes, etc. I also used the project to learn the basics of git and version control, which I'm now fairly comfortable with.
