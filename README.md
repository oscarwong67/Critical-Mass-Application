# Critical-Mass-Application
Hello! Welcome to my Internship Interview Assignment for Critical Mass's Summer 2018 Developer Internship.

## Work / Project Examples
*This is a showcase of a few of my recent work examples*

### CoffeeSpots
[CoffeeSpots](https://koffe.surge.sh/ "CoffeeSpots") is my most recent and largest personal project to date; built using React.js, CoffeeSpots is an application to find the hottest local coffee shops, anywhere in the world. As a personal project, I used CoffeeSpots to both learn React and push my development skills further than they've ever been pushed before. For instance, I learned the ins and outs of React's "state" feature to control the app's UI, as React's state is what allows CoffeeSpots to interactively display information. learned how to use the Google Maps/Places APIs to not only render the application's main map page, but also to find and display the best coffee shops near the user's search area.
